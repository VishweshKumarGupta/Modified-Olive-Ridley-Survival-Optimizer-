# Modified-Olive-Ridley-Survival-Optimizer-
The Olive Ridley Survival Optimizer (ORSO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic
algorithm modeled after the nesting and emergence behavior of Olive Ridley tur-
tles. This document presents the Python implementation of ORSO, including its
core logic, biological parameters, optimization performance, and visualizations of
convergence across multiple runs. Enhancements using adaptive learning strategies
with alpha and beta are also included to improve exploration-exploitation balance.
